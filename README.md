# Part 2 Regression
 Regression with Python :-

- ##### Regression :-  

   Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example if your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. Regression techniques vary from linear regression to SVR and Random Forest Regression.

  

- ##### Types of Regression :- 

  1. Simple Linear Regression

  2. Multiple Linear Regression

  3. Polynomial Regression

  4. Support Vector for Regression (SVR)

  5. Decision Tree Regression

  6. Random Forest Regression

     

- ##### Simple Linear Regression :-

  ​			`y = a + b * x`

  ​			y = Dependent Variable

  ​			a = Constant

  ​			b = Co-efficient

  ​			x = Independent Variable

  ​	eg. 

  ​			`Salary = a + b * Experience`
